    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>Hard working, loyal individual from the Scottish City of Glasgow, Scotlands largest city. After years of working
        in the energy industry and having grown bored of it, I decided to do something about it and put myself through a
        University degree. I am hoping to one day get into full stack development. </p>
